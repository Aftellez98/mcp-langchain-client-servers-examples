# **Simple LangChain Client-Server Example (Azure OpenAI)**
This is a minimal example showcasing how to use a client-server architecture with LangChain, where the client communicates with a server and utilizes an Azure OpenAI model.

## **üß© Overview**
- Server: Handles computation or API requests.

- Client: Uses LangChain and connects to an Azure OpenAI model to send queries to the server.

‚ö†Ô∏è This example does not use memory, making it suitable for stateless use cases or demos.

## üöÄ **How to Run**

### Start the servers

MCP Math Server
```bash
python -m langchain-simple-example.servers.math_server
```

MCP Client Server
```bash
python -m langchain-simple-example.client.client
```

Make sure your environment is set up with any required API keys and dependencies, especially for LangChain and Azure OpenAI.
